# dot_files

These are my config files for common applications I use

It also configures vimium to behave more like my vim set up


Chrome extensions I use:

wasavi - makes text boxes mini vim-like instances for editing text
vimium - make chrome act like vim
rescroll bar - remove large scroll bars
refined github - adds features to github
